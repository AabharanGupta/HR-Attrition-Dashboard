# Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project predicts employee attrition (whether an employee is likely to leave) using logistic regression, with hyperparameter tuning and a custom risk threshold.

## Key Features
1. Logistic Regression with GridSearchCV

2. Handles class imbalance

3. Feature scaling and label encoding

4. Custom risk threshold (e.g., 0.6 instead of default 0.5)

5. Attrition risk scores per employee

6. Feature importance analysis

7. Identifies top high-risk employees
